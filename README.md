# Bharat-CRM
 
 developed a project called Bharat Gas Agency CRM tool, and included various features like gas update, booking gas cylinders, refill history, customer support,  and track gas cylinder. It's also helpful that we have organized the project into different modules, including introduction, project layout, algorithms, and code. This tool includes various features that allow for efficient management of gas bookings, such as customer details, delivery agent details, and gas agency information. In terms of customer details, the tool captures various data points including the customer's name, address, and whether they have a gas connection. We utilized Java language to develop the tool and implemented interface, class objects, and methods, including the date method, to enable its functionality. 

Approach :

We have provided a brief overview of the project, explaining what it is, why it was developed, and who it is intended for. You could also describe the features and benefits of the app.

These modules could include diagrams or flowcharts that show the overall layout of the app and how the different features are connected.

You could describe the algorithms or logic behind each feature of the app. This could include pseudocode or flowcharts that help to explain the steps involved.

These modules could include the actual code for each feature of the app. To make it more systematic, you could use consistent naming conventions and commenting to help others understand the code.

This module could include a video that shows the app in action, demonstrating how each feature works and how users can interact with it.

In addition to these modules, you could also consider including a documentation module that provides instructions on how to install, use, and troubleshoot the app. This could help others who want to use or modify the app in the future.

Technologies Required: Java programming language, IntelliJ IDEA.
